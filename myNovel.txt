This module is suitable for students interested in the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures.
In this module students learn how to analyse, design and implement a finite set of well-defined instructions for accomplishing some task 
along with introductory ways of storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
A well designed data structure or algorithm allows a variety of critical operations to be performed using as little resource,
both execution time and memory space, as possible. Students will use an object-oriented paradigm as the framework of choice for 
building robust and reusable algorithms and data structures in this module.
